## Abstract
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my current knowledge of Java and improve upon that knowlege. This is a text based chess game with coodinate based input. Illigal moves are not allowed by this instance of chess and game states are printed in terminal each time a move is made. 

### Rules
The goal of Chess is to capture the other players king. This is done by using the pieces that you have to both try to corner the opponents king and to capture the opponent's pieces. No piece may make a move that will immediately endandger thier own king. When the opponents king is threatened they are now in check and the words "check" will be output. While in check you may only make moves that will get you out of check. If you are in check and you are unable to make any move that means you are in check mate and the words "check mate" will be output.
#### Pieces:
pawn -  
rook -  
horse -  
bishop -  
queen - 
king - 


### Functionality

## How to run
Copy repository to your file system. Compile and run java files through terminal by creating .class files for each file in this repository with the javac command and then run them with java in terminal. Alternitavly these files can be run in Visual Code Studio or any text editor or IDE of your choosing

## Input guide
White must go first. In order to move a piece first type the coorinates of the space containing the piece you would like to move starting with the corrisponding column letter and then the row number. Capitalization of letters is inconsequential. Then either followed by a single space or by no space at all input the space that you would like that piece to move to using the same method as is used to indicate which piece is being moved. If the move is invalid you will be prompted to input another move.
